		<p>6 World Series titles, 21 National League pennants.</p>
		<h2>Team History</h2>
		<h3>Brooklyn</h3>
				<p>In Brooklyn, the team was not known as the Dodgers until 1932. It
				began as the Brooklyn Atlantics in 1883, joined the American League the
				following year, and finally the <abbr title="National League">NL</abbr>
				in 1890. Before the team's name change, the team won the 
				<abbr title="National League">NL</abbr> pennant 5 times but
				did not win the World Series until after the name change in 1955.
				</p>
				<p>In 1950, real estate businessman Walter O'Malley acquired majority 
				ownership of the Dodgers with the intention of building a 
				state-of-the-art ballpark in Brooklyn. However, New York city planners
				and politicians were unwilling to let O'Malley build the park he wanted.
				O'Malley began to look outside of Brooklyn and debated moving the team
				out of New York.
				</p>
				<p>Los Angeles officials attended the 1956 World Series to try to expand
				baseball teams to move out west. O'Malley pitched his vision for the
				Dodgers' new stadium, and LA agreed to all of O'Malley's conditions.
				The Dodger's owner convinced the owner of their rival, the Giants, to 
				move to San Francisco to continue the rivalry on the west coast, and the 
				deal was done. The Dodgers played their last season in Brooklyn in 1957.
				</p>
			<h3>Los Angeles</h3>
