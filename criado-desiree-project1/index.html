			<h3>Brooklyn</h3>
				<p>In Brooklyn, the team was not known as the <strong>Dodgers</strong> 
				until 1932. It began as the <em>Brooklyn Atlantics</em> in 1883, joined 
				the <abbr title="American League">AL</abbr> the following year, and finally 
				the <abbr title="National League">NL</abbr> in 1890. Before the team's 
				name change, the team won the <abbr title="National League">NL</abbr> 
				pennant 5 times but did not win the World Series until after the name 
			 	 change in 1955.
				</p>
				<p>In 1950, real estate businessman Walter O'Malley acquired majority 
				ownership of the Dodgers with the intention of building a 
				state-of-the-art ballpark in Brooklyn. However, New York city planners
				and politicians were unwilling to let O'Malley build the park he wanted.
				O'Malley began to look outside of Brooklyn and debated moving the team
				out of New York.
				</p>
				
			<h3>Los Angeles</h3>
				<p>Los Angeles officials attended the 1956 World Series to try to expand
				baseball teams to move out west. O'Malley pitched his vision for the
				Dodgers' new stadium, and <abbr title="Los Angeles">LA</abbr> 
				agreed to all of O'Malley's conditions. The Dodger's owner convinced 
				the owner of their rival, the Giants, to move to San Francisco to continue 
				the rivalry on the west coast, and the deal was done. 
				The Dodgers played their last season in Brooklyn in 1957.
				The team's first four seasons in <abbr title="Los Angeles">LA</abbr> 
				were played at the Coliseum until Dodger Stadium was completed in 1962, 
				just in time for Opening Day.

			<h3>New York Yankees</h3>
				<p>
				While the rivalry was much stronger when the Dodgers were on the East
				Coast, these two teams have one of the most well-known rivalries in
				Major League Baseball. The Yankees and Dodgers have met 11 times 
				in the World Series.
				</p>
			<h3>San Francisco Giants</h3>
				<p>
				One of the longest-standing rivalries in American baseball, the 
				Dodgers-Giants rivalry goes back to the late 19th century when both
				teams played in the East Coast. The longevity of the rivalry is due, in
				part, to the success each team has had over the years. With the Giants at
				8 World Series titles and the Dodgers at 6, these powerhouse teams 
				continue to give sports fans one of the most exciting series to watch when 
				they play.
